use the entire system of organisms as an ensemble classifier..breed them all to work on every subject, and then weight them based on their performance (maybe using that one equation of mine: foresight of a container), to produce a total measurement..the sum of products, each product being a weight times a binary determination, which is the binary determination of an individual solution in the chage..so it's a huge ensemble classifier, the size of the zoo, and the whole thing, when it tips into a 1 from a zero, means to buy the stock

use a small neural net, a funnel (upside down pyramid), or line of CAs as the classifier function

in class, make sure we get all the dynamics, at least, of the teoc systems

make a system that uses set inference to do market analysis

those ideas about a system that models the entire world, in order to predict, can I remember what that was all about?

put the lib and class systems in the same server to speed up class requests to the lib?

make a realtime visualization of the zoo/chage

use archetype to do something?

be sure you use the anarchy modulus
