inhesion::rivyr :: A profiler that can estimate or determine personality types, and their relative rarity..like it can know that Riviera's type is rare on the order of one in a couple of million

inhesion::siximys :: Program that takes a model of a system, like a body, a complex ecological system, and given a goal state, finds input actions that lead to the goal state..like what would be needed to make the nerve program used on Case, given the way medicines work..the 5th outshoot, or product, created in the body, is what actually does the work of the medicine..create a system that finds those initial input actions that lead, in a complex system, to the given, or desired, result

inhesion::chage :: Simply the program needed to perform the simulation operated by the bored researcher with his finger permanently pressed on fast forward..maybe this is chage, and it would be needed by, say, the program above, the program that generated the nerve program

Heads up display program, like Molly's digital chip in her optic nerve..assisted reality programs that can bring up needed information in a simple display, a high density dashboard

Armitage's net..like an Infoseek browser from back in the day..just text..just libraries of encased information, passed around like the packages in the pascal swag, compressed, decompressed, indexed, presented instantly

Program that lets you capture McCoy Pauley, the Dixie Flatliene, on tape..a recording of a dead man's personality, knee-jerk reactions, preferences, knowledge, in a way that you can interact with it, collaborate with it, work with it, have it sit over your shoulder in a run..resembling the magazine of a large assault rifle, its surfaces covered with warning decals and security ratings..and that is a ghost, in every sense that we mean the term today..maybe it's even a spirit

The matrix..cyberspace..a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system

Simstim..the ability to experience live or recorded sensory stimulation, directly into your brain..channels of sense

Equivalent of the microsofts, slotted behind the left ear, little pieces of functionality that you can load into your consciousness for added effect, to add functionality to your brain

The five minute pr√©cis..a way to get, from your Infoseek browser, a concise, relevant summary on any topic, based on a variety of sources

Ice and ice breakers..the code of security and attack, automatic intelligent barriers and penetrators, codes and decoders, fences and attackers, moles, Trojans, real viruses, deception, counterdeception..ice..and that's a program that changes its shape, that mutates in stages, becomes entirely new after a phase of its existence and morphs into what it needs to become next..like the mutating viruses of the 80s, but Case's ICE

Riviera's implants..what he imagines, you see

An AI that can go inside your mind, read your memory, and create a world for you from your experiences and locations and people you know..and can interact with you in this imaginary, synthesized, AI-controlled world

An AI that might write you a poem

An AI that makes itself smarter

A credit system..his Freeside chip..maybe winknote..but a money system, a credit system, that makes sense to me, in its formation

Technology so powerful that it's illegal..Sense/Net was in trouble for even owning the McCoy Pauley construct

Computer-human collaboration a-la Case and the Flatline working together to run the matrix..the computer does things that it can do better than the human..the human does things it can do better than the computer..the human is a desire, and an interface to the machine..the machine is an interface with other machines, and with a greater world of consciousness that people alone, or people altogether, cannot understand, cannot comprehend, cannot reach

A storage device for memory, such that experience fed in can be represented, remembered, like Case's memory of New York

Computer systems that repair themselves, in hardware and in software, like the bright corporate spindle of TA's Straylight, like a watchdog script but more complete, more advanced, software that tracks itself and repairs itself to what it was, and what is supposed to become

A computer program that is under compulsion to grow, to learn..it doesn't even know why, but it is compelled to grow

A computer that can flatline you into Morocco, into beaches, with people from your past, people who now exist only as part of a simulation..and leave you there for days..and feel cold

Computer that can control all the features of a building, all the interfaces, the locks, the showers, all the technology inside

Where the number of grains of sand in the beach are counted, and counted using a numbering system only known to the mind of Neuromancer

The computer constructing a thing which thinks, but whose thoughts the computer does not know, cannot know
