inhesion is a library for genetic and cellular programming, written in ANSI C.

We test on Linux and NetBSD.  Other platforms will probably work.

inhesion is BSD licensed.  Support contracts are available for corporate
customers (contact clownfysh@gmail.com).  Other than that, your best bet is to
read the code!
